# kruskal_algorithm_application

Attached you will find: 
- the dataset I used for the following operations: "serie_tv_preferenze_sky.csv"
- the Orange file where I applied MDS to the dataset
- the Excel file where I reproduced and applied the Kruskal algorithm on the same dataset
- the Python file simulating 10 iterations on the dataset using the Kruskal algorithm, which will be displayed in Streamlit

  
This code implements an analysis of viewer preferences for various Sky Italia TV series using the Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) algorithm with Kruskal's method. The app visualizes the evolution of TV series positions in a 2D or 3D space through MDS iterations, showcasing the relationships between series based on viewer preferences.
